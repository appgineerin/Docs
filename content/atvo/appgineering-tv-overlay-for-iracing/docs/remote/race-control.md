# Race Control

ATVO has the ability to receive messages and track incidents, investigations and penalties which come from a remote live race control. The purpose is to **display** this information in your broadcast graphics overlay. The information comes from a remote race control application such as our [ATVO Remote Race Control tool](../tools/remote-race-control.md), or in the future from third party race control applications.

## Summary

* Your ATVO graphics instance starts the Remote - Race Control server.
* ATVO Remote Race Control connects to your ATVO to send race control messages or incident information.
* Messages and incident investigation / penalty information can be displayed in your graphics automatically, controlled from the remote clients.
