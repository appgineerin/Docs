# Standings

The standings tab of the timing screen offers the best overview of the action on track. Here you can see position changes, get information about the latest lap times, get an indication of the current pace of a driver and so much more! Feel free to explore the settings of the timing screen and display all the information necessary for your broadcast.

## Filter
### Car number (#)
This is the field for the car number filter. For example if you enter _**1**_ all cars with a car number that includes the number 1 (i.e. 1, 12, 71, 201) will be shown in the spotter guide.

### Driver or Team Name
With this filter it is possible to filter entries by their name or parts of it. So if you enter *"a"* the timing screen will only show those entries that include the letter *"a"* in their name. Of course you can also enter more than one letter to search for a particular driver or team.

### Class dropdown
Using this dropdown you can define which class you want to display in the timing screen.
