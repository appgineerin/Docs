# Camera Controls

You may have noticed the camera controls in the bottom of the timing screen. This little tool helps you control the cameras in the sim.

![ATVO Camera Controls](../../static/img/timingscreen/timing-screen-camera-controls.png)

### Camera dropdown
The camera dropdown lets you select the camera for the selected driver or scene. The dropdown is populated with the cameras you have configured in iRacing.

### Playback controls
Using the playback controls you can pause, resume, (fast) forward and (fast) rewind.

### Driver and scene selector dropdown
This dropdown lets you select which scene (i.e. Leader, Most Exciting) or which driver to follow.

### Add Bookmark
Adds a bookmark at the very moment you press this button. A bookmark is typically used to mark a interesting moment of the session you might want to jump back to (for example to analyze an incident).

### Live / Replay
The Replay button triggers a replay. By default the replay will jump back 10 seconds in time and play in real-time speed (1x), but different options can be selected.

The Live button will jump back to the previous state (camera and focus driver), just before you started a replay.

### Replay speed dropdown
This dropdown lets you select which playback speed should be used for the replay.

### Replay jump back in time dropdown
By default 10 seconds. Defines the amount of seconds you want to jump back in time when a replay is triggered.

### Use Replay/Live transitions
When checked, clicking Replay or Live will use your selected transition media during the replay or live transition. Check out the Replay & Live Transitions settings.

### Hide UI
If you check this checkbox the iRacing UI will be hidden.

### Auto Apply
When checked every action will be executed immediately.

### Apply
Executes the selected actions (i.e. switching to a new camera or driver).

## Did you know?
As many other parts of ATVO you can undock and dock the *Camera Controls* elsewhere. Simply drag and drop the *Camera Controls* in its subtitle bar. To dock it again you can just drag the camera controls over another ATVO window and it will present you docking options.
