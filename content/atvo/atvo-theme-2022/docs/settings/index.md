# Theme Settings

The theme comes with a large number of settings and customizations that determine various aspects of the functionality and the look of the graphics. Depending on your license level, some settings may be unavailable.

You can access the theme settings via the ATVO settings, under the **Theme Settings** tab.

## Settings files

Your theme settings are stored in a settings file. By default, a hidden file is used, but you can choose to create a new settings file anywhere you wish via the toolbar. You can also open existing settings, or save your current settings to a new file.

## Profiles

You can create any number of different **Profiles**, each with their own settings. You can switch between profiles, and all settings should update accordingly. If you see settings that are not updating when you switch to another profile, please let us know. You can then restart ATVO and reload the theme to ensure the settings are loaded properly.

### Creating profiles

You can create a new profile by using the toolbar under the Profiles header. You can also copy an existing profile.
