# Fastest Lap

The Fastest Lap widget can be used to highlight when a new fastest lap is achieved. It can be shown manually when desired, or set to Auto-show whenever a new fastest lap is set. The widget will briefly display the driver and the laptime before animating out again. 

## Delay and duration settings
In the widget settings, you can configure:
* Delay: wait a few seconds after a new fast lap before showing the widget. If another driver sets another faster lap during this delay, the widget is delayed further, until the fastest lap is not being beaten anymore. The delay is useful to avoid the widget popping up several times when drivers keep beating the fastest lap, especially in the first lap.
* Duration: how long to show the widget before automatically hiding it again.
