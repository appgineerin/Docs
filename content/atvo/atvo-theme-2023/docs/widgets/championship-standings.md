# Championship Standings

The Fullscreen Championship Standings widget can display the live championship after or during a session. When your Championship settings are configured correctly, the widget will also reflect the outcome of the current race. See the [Championship Standings settings](../../settings/championship-standings/) for more information on how to configure the championship.
