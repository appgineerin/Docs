# Message

The Message widget can be used to display any custom message in a central location of the screen. The widget supports a header where you can pick from three different styles: Info, Warning and Penalty. The color of the header is configurable in the custom color styles. You can also override the header text with any other text.

The size of the widget will automatically scale when your message is too long to fit on one line.
