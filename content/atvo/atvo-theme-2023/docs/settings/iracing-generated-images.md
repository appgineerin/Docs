# iRacing Generated Images

For some widgets, the theme can query your local iRacing service for images of a specific driver or car. So far these include:
* Car number images (as defined by the driver in their iRacing UI)
* Helmet images (as defined by the driver OR with a custom paint)
* Car images (as defined in the Paint shop OR with a custom paint)

When enabled, the theme will use images generated by iRacing to display these objects.


## Ensure the iRacing local service is running

Note: this system only works if ATVO is running on a computer where:
* iRacing is installed
* The local iRacing Helper Service is running.

Also note that car images will only show for cars that you have downloaded (but not necessarily purchased).


## Custom paints

The theme is able to show cars and helmets with custom paints (specified as usual via a TGA file), but ATVO has to know about the location of these paints first. To set this location, find the regular ATVO settings (*not* the Theme Settings) and go to **Car, Number and Helmet images**. Here, you can specify the directory where your custom paints are located. Note that this must be a location that ends in 'iRacing/paints'.
