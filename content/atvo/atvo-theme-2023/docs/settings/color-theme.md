# Color Theme

The Color Theme settings allow you to choose between a few predefined color themes, or (depending on your license level) fully customize the color theme at will.

## Predefined color themes

ATVO Theme 2023 comes with three predefined color themes:
* Default (black)
* Light (white)
* Midnight blue

## Custom color themes

To fully customize all colors, choose Custom from the dropdown. You can now see all available colors grouped in various categories. Expand the category of interest and use the color dropdown to select a new color. You can select a color from a set of predefined colors, or use the Advanced tab to input any RGB or hex color code. Please observe that almost all colors on your graphics will change live, while you are editing.

To reset a color back to the default, right-click it and choose Reset Value.

## Copy colors from another profile

Via the link *Copy custom colors from another profile*, you can also copy colors from another profile, or from one of the default themes. Select the desired profile, and the list of custom colors will update to that profile. You can now make changes at will.
