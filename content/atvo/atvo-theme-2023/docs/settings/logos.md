# Logos

Several widgets can display ATVO and Appgineering logos, alongside sometimes your own custom logo if desired. On the Logos settings page, you can choose which built-in logo to display, or choose Custom (if available) to hide the built-in logo. When choosing Custom, you then have to choose your own logo from within the Controls screen of the theme. This will also require you to point the Dynamic Media - Sponsors setting to a folder with your logo or sponsor images.
