# Car Numbers

The Car Numbers tab controls how all car numbers throughout the graphics will behave. You can choose if car numbers should be displayed with an outline, or with various font settings (bold or italic). You can also choose the color of the number and the outline and whether to show a solid background. 

## A note on iRacing generated images
The settings on this page only apply if you have **turned off** *iRacing generated images* for the car numbers. If the theme is instructed to generate car number images via this setting instead, then these settings do not apply.


## Number, background and outline colors

Number, background and outline colors can be chosen to be dynamic based on the driver or team that they belong to. You can choose from various dynamic options such as their defined NumberColors, CarColors, SuitColors, etc. You can also choose *DynamicCSV1* or *DynamicCSV2* specify your own color via the Drivers info spreadsheet (see **Dynamic Data**). The default option *ColorTheme* gives every number the same color as specified in your custom Color Theme settings.

## Number legibility 
In case you have chosen dynamic number and/or outline colors, it may happen that numbers become illegible, for example when both the background and font color are the same. By checking *Ensure numbers are legible*, the theme tries to choose between your theme Default and Alternate number colors, and picks the one that makes the number legible. Note that this only works if either the Number color or Outline color are set to the ColorTheme setting.
