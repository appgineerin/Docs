# What is the ATVO Theme 2023?

ATVO Theme 2023 is our first publicly available graphics package included with ATVO by default. It is designed to be a general-purpose package that everyone can start using, while still allowing a good degree of flexibility and customization.


## Getting started

To get started, you can load the theme directly from ATVO's welcome screen; either under the `Getting Started` header, or under the `ATVO Themes` header.

After loading, you'll be presented with the theme's **Controls screen**, which you can use to control the theme. You can show or hide all the widgets and control their display modes here.


## Settings and customization

Settings and customizations can be found under the **Theme Settings** tab in the ATVO settings.

The theme comes with a large number of settings and customizations that determine various aspects of the functionality and the look of the graphics. Depending on your license level, some settings may be unavailable.

Please have a look at the detailed documentation under the Settings menu.
