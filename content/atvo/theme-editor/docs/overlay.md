# Overlay

The Overlay editor is your main workplace to design a theme. This is where you create and place your widgets.

In this example I added a widget consisting of a image I added before creating a widget.

![Theme Editor overlay editor with widget](/img/editor-overlay-widget.png)

In this case the overlay would show the iRacing live logo in the top right corner of the overlay area.

**Note:** If you want to add images to your theme (which will most likely be the case) you need to add the image first by right-clicking on **'Images'** on in the Theme Explorer on the right side and select **'Add image...'**. After you have added an image it will be accessible for the widgets you might create.
