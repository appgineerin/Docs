# Scenes

In the scenes editor you can create your own scenes.

![Theme Editor Scenes](/img/editor-scenes.png)

A scene is a collection of widgets.

e.g.: It can be useful to have scenes to quickly switch what you would like to show on stream or in the editor, instead of disabling/enabling widgets one-by-one.
