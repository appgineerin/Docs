![](/img/tab-manage-profile-details.png)

The `Manage profile` tab allows you to manage your Live Timing profiles and their rooms. Each profile may contain
multiple rooms. Within the `Manage profile` tab, there are several more tabs which allow you to change several different
bits of your profile. (1)

## Details

The `Details` tab allows you to change your general profile properties such as its name (2), description (3), website
(4) and logos.

Similar to logos for race events, logos for profiles may be set up in two different variations: one for light and one
for dark mode. When clicking on the `Update logos` button, a dialog pops up where you can specify the logos of your
profile.

The `Rooms` tab allows you to manage the set of rooms associated with your currently selected profile. Here you can
create a new room, edit the currently selected one from the list, or delete it.

### Create Room

name for your room.

Additionally, you may want to override the appearance of your room for example to reflect the color scheme of a certain
racing series. The colors section allows you to select from a set of accent and background colors. The accent color
is the color in which highlighted elements will appear in the timing page of your room while the background color is the
color in which the background of your room appears. These colors affect both the light and dark mode appearance of your
room.

You can also set up your room to not highlight the currently followed car. By default, the currently followed car will
be highlighted in your selected accent color within your Live Timing room. Highlights affect not only the timing table
but also the track map and distance line above the timing table.

With a click on the `OK` button, the room will be created.

### Edit Room

To edit a room, you can either select the room you want to edit and click the `Edit room` button or simply double-click
the room you would like to edit. Once done, the same dialog as for creating a room appears. Within this dialog, you may
change the desired properties of the room and hit the `OK` button to save your changes.

### Delete Room

To delete a room, you need to selected the room you would like to delete. After that, you may click the `Delete room`
button. A popup appears asking you whether you are certain you want to delete the room. Once you click on `OK`, the room
will be deleted immediately and irreversible.

## Share Access

The `Share access` tab allows you to share access to your profiles to other users and manage their access level to your
profile. More information about the different access levels and their permissions can be found here. // TODO link
The `Share access` tab gives you an overview of all users having access to your profile. By default, it only lists you
as the owner of your profile.

### Grant Access

To grant any user access to your currently selected profile, click on the `Grant access` button. Enter the users email
address in the appearing dialog and select the users access level. With a click on the `OK` button, the user will be
granted access to the profile if a user with the entered email address exists. Neither Live Timing nor ATVO will notify
the grantee about the newly granted access to a profile.

To revoke the access of another user to your profile, you can simply select the user your want to revoke the access for
from the list of users. After that, click on the `Revoke access` button. You will be prompted to confirm the operation.
