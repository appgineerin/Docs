# Event

![](/img/tab-event.png)

The event tab gives you control over the event that you want to broadcast. Which this tab you can set up all the
different properties for your event, such as the title (1), description (2), the URL to your broadcast (3), as well as
a set of logos (4).

Logos may come in two different variations: one for dark mode and one for light mode. Of course, you can simply use the
same logo for both cases, however, if for example you want to use black or white text, you should make sure that your
text remains legible in both scenarios.

To update the logos of your event, simply click the `Update logos` button. In doing so, a new dialog pops up which lets
you choose the logos for your event.
