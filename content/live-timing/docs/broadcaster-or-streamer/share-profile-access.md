To share profile access with another user. To do so, simply open the Live Timing window within ATVO and select to the
`Manage profile` tab. Within this tab, select the `Share access` tab to see all users having access to your profile.

From here, you may grant access to other Appgineering users or revoke their access. There are a few different access
levels to choose from:

* **Owner**: the owner of a profile has full access rights and may update, or delete the profile, create, update or delete rooms and
race events.
* **Administrate**: an admin or a profile may create or update rooms, update the profile or its race events but is not
allowed to delete anything.
* **Broadcast**: a broadcaster of a profile may only run Live Timing broadcasts in any room of this profile.
