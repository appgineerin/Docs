# Manage Profiles

To manage your Live Timing profiles, simply open the Live Timing window within ATVO and select to the `Manage profile`
tab. Within this tab, select the `Details` tab to see the profile details of the currently selected profile.

To switch the selected profile, you can simply select one from the dropdown at the top of the window. If you want to
create a new profile or delete the currently selected one, you can do so from the menu bar at the top of the window.

Here, you may update your profile's details as well as upload an image. This image will later be displayed on the Live
Timing website. Once you made your changes, hit the `Save` button.

Additionally, here you may also [manage your rooms within the selected profile](../manage-rooms).
