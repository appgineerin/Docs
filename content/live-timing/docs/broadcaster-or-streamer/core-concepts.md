# Core Concepts

Before diving into how to create rooms and start broadcasting, you should take the time to get to know the core concepts
and different elements behind Live Timing.

## Profiles, Rooms, and Events

The structure of things behind Live Timing consists of three main elements, all of which can be setup from within ATVO.
Any user may create or have access to several profiles as well as rooms and events. It is important, however, to
understand the hierarchical structure behind these things.

### Profiles

Profiles are the top level organizational structure within Live Timing. A profile is a users identity within Live
Timing. This identity can have a name, description, and logo and may be shared with other users.

A user may work for several different broadcasters and therefore produce broadcasts to YouTube, Twitch, or other
platforms as a specific broadcaster. However, users always use their ATVO with their personal Appgineering account.
Therefore, a user may create different profiles within the Live Timing settings window to ensure a matching outfit
between the streaming service and Live Timing.

To ensure that multiple users have access to a profile, users may share the access to their profiles with others. Within
sharing this access, other users may - depending on their permissions - create new rooms or simply be able to broadcast
to an already existing room. Sharing access to a profile grants access to all the profiles rooms and race events.

### Rooms

A room is an entity where a Live Timing event ins contained within. Profiles may create multiple rooms to be able to
broadcast multiple events at the same time. For example a broadcaster may create a room called `My Room 1` and
`My Room 2`. This would allow for multiple events under the same profile at the same time.

### Race Event

A race event defines an event which is currently being broadcasted to a room as a certain profile. For example
`24h NÃ¼rburgring` would be a race event which could be broadcasted to `My Room 1`.
