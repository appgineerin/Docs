# Track Map

The track map shows every car where they are around the track. Cars which are semi-transparent are current on pit road
or no longer in the session.

Every car is shown as a small rectangle in the cars class colors containing the cars number. Additionally, the sector
(S1, S2, etc.) lines as well as the start-finish (S/F) line is marked on the track map so you can easily spot when a
car is about to cross a sector or the finish line.

If the broadcaster has focus highlighting enabled, the currently focused car will be marked by a blue rectangle.
