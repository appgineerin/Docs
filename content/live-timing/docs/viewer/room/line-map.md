# Line Map

The line map shows the current distance of every car around the track. The closer a cars number is to the right, the
further it is around the track.

Every car is shown as a small rectangle in the cars class colors containing the cars number.

If the broadcaster has focus highlighting enabled, the currently focused car will be marked by a blue rectangle.
