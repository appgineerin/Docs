# Filter

Depending on which [tab](../tabs) you are currently in, a different filter will appear. Filters allow you to filter the
displayed data to just the cars, classes or drivers you would like to look at. Several different filters are available,
which will all be covered below.

A filter in general consists of several inputs with different meanings. For example, you can filter by car number. Each
filter additionally contains a title to the far left and a `Clear` button to the far right. Clicking on the `Clear`
button will reset the filter and clear every input field.

## Default

The default filter contains three different elements you can filter on.

### \#

The `#` filter allows you to filter by car number. Simply enter a number and every car containing the entered number
will remain in the list. If you enter number `7` in the input, cars with the numbers `7`, `76`, `007`, etc. will all
show up. Cars with numbers not containing the number `7` will be hidden.

### Driver or Team Name

As the name suggests, the `Driver or Team Name` filter allows you to enter any driver or team name - or even only parts
of it. Upon typing, the input will suggest existing driver and/or team names to you.

The `Driver or Team Name` filter ignores character casing, meaning it does not matter if you enter the names in all
lower-case or all upper-case letters.

### Classes

The `Classes` filter allows you to filter for one or more car classes. Within the filter you can see a list of all
available car classes and can check each class you would like to filter for. At the very top of the filter, you can find
an input where you can search for car classes by name.

You can select none, one or more car classes. Selecting no car class has the same effect as selecting all car classes.
If any car class is selected, only the cars of the selected car class(es) will show up in Live Timing.

The small `X` next to the name of a car class in the input field itself allows you to quickly deselect a single
selected car class.

## Session Events

Session events filters contain the same filters as the default with one addition.

The `Session Event Types` filter functions similar to the `Classes` filter where you can select none, one or more
session event types from the list of available session event types. Again, you can search the available session events
within the filter input. Selecting no session event has the same effect as selecting multiple.

![](/img/lt-room-filter-session-events-selected.png)

The small `X` next to the name of a session event type in the input field itself allows you to quickly deselect a single
selected session event type.

## Single Entry

![](/img/lt-room-filter-entry.png)

The `Single Entry` filter allows you to select a single entry from the entry list. This filter is mainly used in
[analytics](../analytics).

## Multiple Entries

![](/img/lt-room-filter-entries.png)

The `Multiple Entry` filter allows you to select a single or multiple entries from the entry list. This filter is mainly
used in [analytics](../analytics) to compare data between different entries.
