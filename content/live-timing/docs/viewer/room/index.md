# Room

This page will give you an overview of the available features within a room. The following pages will then give you a
more in-depth look into the different parts of the page.

The main page for a Live Timing room is divided into multiple sections.

1. [Header](./header)
2. [Tabs](./tabs)
3. [Filters](./filter)
4. [Line Map](./line-map)
5. [Content](./timing-table)

## 1. Header

Up to is the header section. Here you can see the name of the current race event as well as the profile name of the
broadcaster. If the broadcaster is verified by us, a little tick-mark will show up next to the profile name.

Below that race event information are some global stats of the race event. The following stats show up from left to
right:

* **Session Name**: This shows the in-game name of the current session. Typical session names are `PRACTICE`,
  `QUALIFYING`, or `RACE`. In special cases such as heat racing, the session name be `HEAT 1`, `FEATURE RACE` or
  similar.
* **Time Remaining**: Contains the time remaining of the current session. If a race distance is not determined by time
  this stat is not being shown. The format is `HH:MM:SS`, where `HH` is hours, `MM` minutes, and `SS` seconds remaining.
* **Lap**: Lap will only appear in a race session and shows the current and total laps of a race if it is determined by
  a certain lap count.
* **Weather**: Shows the current weather conditions at the start finish line. Possible values are `Clear`,
  `Partly Cloudy`, `Mostly Cloudy`, and `Overcast`. This stat gives an indication of how cloudy the skies above the
  racetrack are.
* **Air Temp**: Shows the current air temperature at the start finish line in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
* **Track Temp**: Shows the current tack temperature at the start finish line in Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Next to the track temperature, there is large colored box. This box is the current flag state of the session. Most of
the time, the box is green and therefore the session is green. Other possible flags could be yellow, white or checkered.

## 2. Tabs

Each room contains a series of tabs. The default and main tab is `Timing Table`. The [following pages](./tabs)
will go into more detail about the available tabs.
